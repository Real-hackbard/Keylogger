A keylogger is a piece of software or hardware designed to record and read all keystrokes on a computer keyboard. Software keyloggers are preferred because they can be easily installed on devices and no physical access is required. Keyloggers fall into the category of spyware.

### Important:
```
Older Delphi versions may experience compiler problems; in these cases, the type name
"PWideChar" must be rewritten to "PAnsiChar".
```

</br>

Software keylogger: This software inserts itself between the operating system and the keyboard to read the input and then forward it to the operating system. The recorded data is then sent to another computer over the internet or saved on the hard drive of the monitored computer.

Hardware keyloggers: Hardware keyloggers require direct physical access to the affected computer to be used. Hardware keyloggers are primarily used when it is not possible or practical to install a software keylogger on the affected device. They are inserted directly between the keyboard and the computer. Hardware keyloggers, which store the captured information in integrated memory, such as RAM, are subsequently removed. Other hardware keyloggers can send the logged data over networks or wirelessly.

Keylogger data can represent a valuable IT forensic source that can be used by IT forensic experts to investigate security incidents. The use of keyloggers in corporate environments is not completely prohibited, but a detailed legal review is recommended before use.
